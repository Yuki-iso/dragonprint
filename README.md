# dragonprint
Hello
I am making a sort of funky print, like cowsay
but more restrictive

SHOULD be used with roflcat!!!


written in rust because I want to learn it


todo:

create the 3 modes
multiprompts
pre-render

todo cli options:
live render from cli
add to prompts file from cli

credits??!
the dragonpplustumblrquotes file has the source of the quotes and ascii dragon 
 (maybe inline, maybe run a command that shows info about the last prompt in that terminal sesh!)
