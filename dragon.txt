3 modes, fit, regular and fill

multiline input:
	every line will be handled as new

line input, check length, if fit within 1 line do that (leaving minimal space on both sides)

if not, do regular, which does what it do now
	cuts at spaces, but a good whitespace before and after
BUT check if last line in regular can be put on the one before it 
	if it can, do that, by applying the fit rules to all lines before it
		so using fit on more lines is fill!
		
^^^

when you need a newline, put it as a seperate sting, it will be handled as a new input
	meaning that the top can be FIT, but the newline can be regular, or something


create input file for this, every line is a new input, every string defined with ""
	want a newline in the msg? these 2 are 2 sperate strings, but on the same line
		ex oneline: "this is a oneliner";
		ex multiline: "this is a multiline", "I am on a new line", "I am on a newer line";
		both are on the same line (,'s and ;'s might be different)
		
maybe create a file with formatted strings, that have the correct whitespaces before and after, so can just print without calc (faster)
	live file with raw input to be formatted (using above rules (fit regular and fill))
